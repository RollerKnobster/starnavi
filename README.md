-# starnavi
-
-A simple restful api based social network.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-What packages you need to install
-
-pip install django, djangorestframework, pyhunter, clearbit, requests, elizabeth
-
-## Deployment
-
-python manage.py makemigrations
-
-python manage.py migrate
-
-python bot.py (MAKE SURE THE DATABASE IS FRESH AND EMPTY, AND THE SERVER IS RUNNING)
-
-python manage.py runserver
-
-## Note on hunter.io and clearbit
-
-Even though Elizabeth generates fake emails, hunter.io still thinks they're legit because it only
-
-checks them with a regex and pokes the SMTP server for liveliness. Because of the same reason, clearbit
-
-is unable to fetch first and last names for users based on their emails. This is why to check their
-
-implementations for correctness you'll have to manually send a request for registering with emails
-
-which are clearly fake or broken for hunter, or real for clearbit.
